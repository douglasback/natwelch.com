      <p>My name is  Nathaniel Welch, my friends call me Nat. During the school year I study Computer  Science and English at Cal Poly, San    Luis Obispo. </p>
      <p>I am  currently interning  with the Dreamweaver QE team. I am working on many aspects  of testing the software, but I have spent most of my time finding bugs between  Appleâ€™s soon to be released OSX 10.5 and Dreamweaver. </p>
      <p>My passions  include learning about new technologies and how technology is used to connect  people around the world. </p>
      <p>I also  enjoy Design, Photography, Short Stories, and Science Fiction. </p>
      <p>In my free  time I like to backpack, program, read, write, and photograph. </p>
      <p>I am 19 and  an Eagle Scout.</p>
