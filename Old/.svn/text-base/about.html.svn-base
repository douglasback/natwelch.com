He is a college student and learns quickly. Nat believes in both Free Speech and Free Beer yet he is not afraid to work hard for the pay check he knows he needs to survive.

In the great words of some unnameable individual, Nat Welch is “The Man”. PseudoWeb.Net is one of Nat’s crazy ideas. It is his way to escape into the realm of cyber-space. It was born august 2004 and has been updated ever since. You are currently looking at version 6.01 which was born on Labor Day 2006 when a large server crash forced him to start from scratch.

The programs <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/studio/">Macromedia Dreamweaver 8</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/">Adobe Photoshop CS2</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> help PseudoWeb live, although it has been known to live off of a healthy diet of elbow grease and love.
