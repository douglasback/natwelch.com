Congratulations to both of you! 

Katrina, I know we haven't spent much time together, but Austin is an amazing man (generous, kind, creative, etc) as you already know. I am so glad you have both found each other, and I wish you happiness and success for the many years to come.

Lots of love,
Nathaniel Welch
