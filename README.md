# Nat Welch Dot Com

This is my personal website code. No idea what's entirely in here. My site is a constantly changing beast. My biggest inspiration comes from sites listed on <http://pinboard.in/u:icco/t:personal/>

This is my site. Feel free to be inspired or disgusted, but don't steal. You are a creative individual, do it yourself.

Current Version: 14
Next Version: 15

## Ideas for next version

 * Site will be dynamic
 * Mixture of jekyll and server
 * Webmentions and indie comments (RSVPs as well)
 * All posts originate here
   * Then external sites republish (tumble for links, flickr for photos, twitter for commentary)
   * no more pseudoweb.net or tumble.io?
 * Index with http://letteringjs.com/
