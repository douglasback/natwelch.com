Hofstadter's Law says that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law." In my mind, this quote could easily be applied to Sara's time in Davis, many of Reed's side projects, the time Reed spent in Sunnyvale or any other timed event. But I don't want to lecture you on the struggles of your past, but rather a recently started endeavor. Two people, who I think are incredibly well matched, intelligent, creative and beautoful people.


Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence. Remember that our sons and our grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.

"Grant me the strength to accept the things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference." - The Serenity Prayer
