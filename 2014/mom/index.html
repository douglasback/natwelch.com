    Hey Mom,
    </p>

    <p>
    I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and happy Mother's Day from the other side of the world. I know I will see you soon, but just know that I wouldn't be the person I am today without your love, kindness, support, creativity and encouragement.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lots of Love,<br>
    Nat
