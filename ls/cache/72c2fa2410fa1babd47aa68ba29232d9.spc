<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/3964727591/" title="Flickr page for this photo">Logitech Anywhere Mouse</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/" title="My flickr page">Nat W.</a></p>

<p>So I was going to write this in depth review of the <a href="http://bit.ly/bUtxmr" title="Logitech Anywhere Mouse on Amazon.com">Logitech Anywhere Mouse</a>.
But then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" title="Cory Doctorow on Wikipedia">Cory Doctorow</a> went ahead and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/02/15/logitech-anywhere-mo.html">wrote a great review of it</a>.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with everything he says. I bought one in early August when
trying to find a new mouse for work. I needed something that worked on my glass
desk, felt good in my hand, and was under $80. The Anywhere MX did all of these
things, so I went ahead and ordered one from amazon.</p>

<p>It worked great, and I happily used it for four months. I loved it so much in
fact that earlier this month I bought another one for my home. The mouse works
great in Linux, Windows, and OS X (I use all three with it everyday), without
the need for any extra software. The scroll wheel works really well, and I
actually prefer the separate button for middle clicking, it just seems more
intuitive than clicking a wheel down.</p>

<p>Before, I bought my second Anywhere mouse, I also briefly tried out the
<a href="http://bit.ly/cj29vT" title="Logitech Performance Mouse MX on Amazon.com">Performance MX</a>. While I can see some people liking it, I found the mouse
to be large, bulky and uncomfortable. I was especially bothered by the fact
that on this mouse you used the button to toggle the scroll speeds while the
wheel was your third button. I really wish companies would realize that
consistency in interface is key. Anyway, I used it for a week and then returned
it, which thanks to Amazon being awesome, was no hassle at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, I highly recommend the <a href="http://bit.ly/bUtxmr" title="Logitech Anywhere Mouse on Amazon.com">Logitech Anywhere MX mouse</a>.</p>

<p>cya later,<br/>

CSC484 is a class offered
by the computer science department titled User Centered Interaction Design, and
is taught by Dr. Franz Kurfess.</p>

<p>CSC484 changes every time it is taught, mainly due to the fact that
computer interaction is something that is constantly changing. New devices and
designs are being invented daily, which have the possibility to dramatically
change the space.</p>

<p>This quarter, our class is working with Yahoo, developing possible UIs for some
of their internal tools. My team, team hzzah!, has been tasked with making a
workflow management tool. Basically, Yahoo needs a better UI than the current
gigantic table they have for tracking instances of various workflows/processes
that are being enacted by their IT team. To solve this problem, we are trying
to design a few different interfaces. One of these is a circle with spokes to
describe an entire process and all of the instances of that process that
currently exist.</p>

<p>After a little searching, my team member <a href="http://reedmorse.com/">Reed</a> stumbled
across <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>.  This little javascript
framework lets you do all kinds of fun HTML5 canvas stuff in a nice abstract
way. Before I walk you through it, I figured I would dump a bunch of it in
front of you.</p>

<p>Cool right? There are some interesting things to notice about this code. First
of all, when the page is loaded, the setup function is called. This function
should in theory instantiate your classes and set things that probably will not
change, like background color.</p>

<p>Next checkout the draw function. This is an interesting function because it is
called every time a frame needs to be rendered, which since we have our frames
per second set at 60, this function is called 60 times every second. This can
present some interesting concurrency problems, because if you loop through a
group of functions that modify similar areas of the page (like write text to a
DOM element) you will quickly notice that they are stomping on each other.</p>

<p>Processing.js works using a cartesian plane, so if you take a look at all of
the functions on the <a href="http://processingjs.org/reference">processing.js reference page</a>,
most of them are pretty straight forward. For instance, to draw any sort of
quadrilateral, you just need the four points, and processing.js will just draw
it for you.</p>

<p>Finally, once you have your code written, you probably want to be able to
display it one a page. The processing.js package comes with a very nice little
script to insert your processing code into a canvas element. The file is called
init.js in the archive you can download, but I've also included it here, just
in case.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * This code searches for all the &lt;script type=&quot;application/processing&quot; target=&quot;canvasid&quot;&gt;</span>

<span class="cm"> * It is useful to smooth the process of adding Processing code in your page and starting</span>

<p>In reality, that's all you need to know. I've found processing.js a really fun
language to code in, because it works well when using mooTools or jquery or any
other javascript framework. Probably my biggest issue is that I've totally
forgotten how to use trigonometry in the years since highschool, so I've spent
a decent amount of time on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry">Wikipedia</a> and
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1063/icco">StackOverflow</a> re-learning my maths.</p>

write more about current topics. The reason I had wanted to be inspired more,
beyond the general want to think about things more, was so I could reach a goal
of publishing one blog post a week. Since I want these blog posts to be
relatively centered on thoughts I've had throughout the week, I figure if
automatically I email myself a list of urls and the thoughts I had on them,
hopefully I can come up with a decent blog post.</p>

<p>So I wrote a little Bash script to run every Saturday morning and email me the
summary of my week, according to delicious. I will spend the rest of this
article explaining on how it works. If you would like, you can just look at the
source, located at <a href="http://github.com/icco/re-delicious">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>The Script</h2>

<p>I'm not going to tell you how to write bash scripts here, there are many TLDPs
on that subject (see the reference section). But I will do a quick walk-through.</p>

<p>The first few lines figure out the parameters we will be passing to the
delicious.com API, mainly the dates we want, and the specific format those
dates must be in.</p>

<p>After that we define the API URL that we will be getting and put the date
parameters into the proper format.</p>

<p>Then we make sure you've passed in the proper parameters. If you haven't we
display an error, else we put all of the URL parts together.</p>

<p>Finally we print out some info, and use curl to pull the data from the URL we
constructed. Note the -s on curl. This is important so we don't get garbage
filling our script about how long it took to pull down the script.</p>

<p>At the very end we take what we curl'd and pass it through an XSLT processor to
give us a nice format and print this out. We could have just printed out the
XML, but that is kind of a pain to read normally.</p>

<h2>The XSLT</h2>

<p>I found writing XSLT files a pain. But basically this is how they work. First
you define that this is a XSLT file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;xsl:stylesheet</span> 
   <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">&quot;1.0&quot;</span> 
   <span class="na">xmlns:xsl=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;</span>
   <span class="na">xmlns:str=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://exslt.org/strings&quot;</span> 
   <span class="na">extension-element-prefixes=</span><span class="s">&quot;str&quot;</span>
   <span class="na">exclude-result-prefixes=</span><span class="s">&quot;str&quot;</span> <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Then you need to define how to turn the XML into plain text (or what ever
format of text you want...). Note how we do matching in a similar structure to
the actual XML.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;xsl:output</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">&quot;html&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
 
<span class="nt">&lt;xsl:template</span> <span class="na">match=</span><span class="s">&quot;post&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:text&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;#10;</span> ----------- <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:text&gt;</span>
   Title: <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;@description&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:if</span> <span class="na">test=</span><span class="s">&quot;@extended&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      Description: <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;@extended&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:if&gt;</span>
   URL: <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;@href&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
   When: <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;@time&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<h2>Cron</h2>

<p>The following is the cron command I have set up.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">42 7 * * 6 re-delicious.sh uname <span class="nb">pwd</span> | 
    mail -s <span class="s2">&quot;Links for `date +&quot;</span>Week %V of %G<span class="s2">&quot;`&quot;</span> you@email.com
</code></pre>
</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's very possible that it would be easier to write this in another language or
something, but It ended up being a fun little script. The main advantage you
would gain by writing it in another language is having a good XML parser, so
you could skip using XSLT to parse your XML file.</p>

<p>Anyway, hope you found this interesting.</p>

<p>Adios,<br/>

I've been using it since 0.7, and it has stood by my as
an easy straight forward blogging system. Wordpress is incredibly flexible and
easily extendible.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that Wordpress has become rather bloated lately. It has a
lot of features to mess around with, but I've lost the time to care about
making sure it is up-to-date. Also I've been wanting to be able to work better
offline for a while now.</p>

<h1>First Attempts</h1>

<p>The first thing I began doing was some research. Not a lot of systems provided
what I was looking for, but <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, from one of the guys that works on
GitHub, looked promising. I took that, and some of the other systems I found,
and used them as inspiration for what I wanted to use.</p>

<p>Some things that I found I liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing posts and saving them in markdown</li>
<li>The ability to view and work on the site offline</li>
<li>An abstract theme setup. Doesn't have to be much, but and easy way to style
the blog would be nice.</li>
<li>An easy way to store what I write in version control</li>
</ul>


<p>Jekyll met a lot of these requirements, and inspired even more of them.
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Tom Preston-Werner's article</a> on why he wrote Jekyll really spoke to me, but
Jekyll seemed to have some issues. First it required you to have ruby set up on
your server. At the time, I did not have this, nor had I had good luck using
ruby gems (which I recently discovered was because I was missing the debian
package ruby1.8-dev). So I considered writing my own Jekyll clone in PHP. I
didn't get very far, due to the whole me being in school thing and recently
<a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/11/24/ifixit-answers-do-not-return-product-to-store/">releasing Answers</a>.</p>

<h1>Jekyll</h1>

<p>Since I had recently switched to a new web host (<a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>) which
supported Ruby and I had started learning Ruby (thanks to <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">why_'s guide</a>).
I decided to port my blog to Jekyll. Setting up the system was straight forward
thanks to all of the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites" title="Jekyll Sites">examples of people using Jekyll already</a>, but I'll
give a little overview for those of you interested. The results of me following
these steps can be found at <a href="http://icco.github.com">icco.github.com</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new GitHub repository titled username.github.com.</li>
<li>Add the files _config.yml and README</li>
<li>Add the folders _posts and _layouts</li>
<li>Start working on your site. Every time you push to GitHub, your site will regenerate.</li>
<li>You can also look at <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blog-migrations">this script</a> which will let you import a Wordpress blog.</li>
</ol>


<p>I still haven't installed Jekyll on HostGator, but using GitHub's support for
CNAMEs and post-receive hooks, I'll figure something out.</p>

<p>I use Vim daily, and as such, I've picked up some key bindings which I think make the program just a little more perfect.</p>

<pre>
&quot; Because we like our line numbers sometimes...
:nnoremap &lt;C-N&gt;&lt;C-N&gt; :set invnumber&lt;CR&gt;

&quot; But we don't always wanna wrap
:nnoremap &lt;C-w&gt;&lt;C-w&gt; :set invwrap&lt;CR&gt;

&quot; And all the cool kids need to paste
:nnoremap &lt;C-p&gt;&lt;C-p&gt; :set invpaste&lt;CR&gt;

&quot; Use the space key to open and close code folds
:vnoremap &lt;space&gt; zf&lt;CR&gt;
:nnoremap &lt;space&gt; zd&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>


<p>When reading this, remember that the vim configuration file uses " for comments.</p>

<p>So first off I set Ctrl+n to turn line numbers on and off. All you need to do is tap Ctrl+n twice and line numbers will disappear or reappear. This becomes helpful when trying to switch between reading code and needing to copy something into your Instant Messenger.</p>

<p>The next thing I set is Ctrl+w to turn line wrapping on and off. I find line wrapping very annoying, but being able to hit Ctrl+w twice and get the entire line on the screen has proven useful when reading poorly formatted Readme.txts or mysql dumps.</p>

<p>The third binding is something I learned of recently and have fallen in love with. Basically, if you tap Ctrl+p twice before pasting text from an external source (lets say a website or something) vim inserts the text as it looks, instead of trying to do auto-formatting. This is especially useful if posting code with comments in it.</p>

<p>The final key binding lets me open and close code folds by just using spacebar. This is pretty sweet and useful when you need to ignore blocks of text at the same time. You can learn more about code folding with <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mjmcguff/learn/vim/folding.txt">this writeup by Dr. Michael McGuffin</a> or with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=vim%20code%20folding&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=undefined">a simple Google search</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, before I forget. nmap is a binding in normal mode, vmap is a binding for visual mode, and imap is a binding for insert mode. The letters "nore" in-between the mode specifier and map make it so we don't check for recursive mappings. This is useful here because we are binding the space bar and our bindings have spaces in them.</p>

<p>Anyway, hope this was useful, or at least informative.

While I agree, this is pretty cool, I've recently fallen in love with using find to find things (what a crazy concept) in my code.</p>

<p>I got this little trick from <a href="http://davpt.com">one of my coworkers</a>, which I now use to find just about anything in my code repositories:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gfind <span class="s2">&quot;*php&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;code I want&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>You'll notice that that line wont work for you, so put the following in your ~/.bashrc file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gfind <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span> 
   find . -name <span class="s2">&quot;${1}&quot;</span> -exec grep -Hin <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">3</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${2}&quot;</span> <span class="o">{}</span> <span class="se">\;</span> ; 
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This means that it will only look at files that end in php, so of course it will stay out of your .svn or .git directories.</p>

<p>But of course this isn't the best option. What if you want to call the following:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gfind <span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;search string&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>You need to change the gfind definition to do the equivalent of what Prentice was doing, but with find.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gfind <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
   find Code -name <span class="s2">&quot;${1}&quot;</span> -a ! -wholename <span class="s1">&#39;*/.*&#39;</span> -exec grep -Hin <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">3</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${2}&quot;</span> <span class="o">{}</span> <span class="se">\;</span> ; 
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>If you want to learn more about find or grep you can check out the man pages on your system or the Wikipedia pages for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)">find command</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep command</a>.</p>

There are lots of places on campus that I never see due to the large amount of time I spend cooped up in the lab, so last weekend I went around and took some photos of the current state of campus. Some interesting developments is that they redid the soccer fields out on the edge of campus. Also I never noticed the sweet graffiti in the Architecture building.</p>

<p>Well today we ushered in a new era. I'm not sure exactly what I want to say about this, except that President Obama's Inaugural Address was beautiful, as was the inaugural poem. I have stolen the New York Times transcriptions of these for safe keeping, but I'm going to publish my copies here.</p>

<p>Finally the above image was grabbed off of Flickr, which has a great pool of photo's from the event.</p>

It's not overly <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">cynical</a>, nor does show <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">how to rule the world</a>. It is not centered on <a href="http://kotaku.com/">video games</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">tools</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/">food</a> or <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">technology</a>. These views can be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>What I see is art. I don't see art in everything, but I do see it in a lot of things. Today as I was listening to music, I felt that I should share that on my blog, because, where else do we share these sorts of things?</p>

<p>So what I want to talk about is Album Art.</p>

<p><a title="iTunes Screenshot by Nat W, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/3097410656/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/3097410656_806f28e5ed.jpg" alt="iTunes Screenshot" width="500" height="313" /></a></p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>I know this goes against the time honored statement of "don't judge a book by it's cover" but let's be honest, you often need to enjoy a whole package, wrapping paper and all. I feel that this is incredibly true when it comes to music. I love music, and for those who have visited my room (or looked at <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/icco">my last.fm profile</a>) notice that I almost always have music going. When iTunes added support for album covers, I started making sure that all of my music had the correct covers. This forced me to research artists more, often taking me to their websites, Wikipedia pages, myspace profiles and other reaches of the internet.</p>

<p>So I would like to take a moment to post some album art. It's not my favorite album art, but it is good album art. At some point I think I need to write more about new albums I get, or something, but I'll just put these images up. Please try to enjoy them for what they are, good pieces of graphic design.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2008/12/image-5.bmp" rel="lightbox[set1]" title="Nine Inch Nails">

   <img title="Johnny Cash" src="/images/2008/12/image-3.bmp" alt="" width="194" height="192" />
</a></p>

<p>Well before I sign off, I would like you to take notice of another thing about these covers. They all try to portray a general mood about the album. "The Man Comes Around" was one of Johnny Cash's last albums, notice how the man (Cash himself) looks worn yet proud? Blu and Exile's "Below The Heavens" was their debut album. Look at that smile, like a freshman's first day of school. Nine Inch Nails defined grunge. And look at that "With Teeth"  cover, if that doesn't remind you of industrial-ness I don't know what will. Finally Iron and Wine's "The Sheppard's Dog" is a calm album that has a panting yet warm and happy looking dog on the cover. This is a folk-rock album, and while it isn't a perfect fit, I do beleive the dog works.</p>

<p>Anyways, just some pretty pictures for you folks.</p>

<p>This article really spoke to me, because I find more often than not, I am more interested in the community behind a topic or trend then I do the actual topic/trend. It's not that I don't enjoy and love said topic, because otherwise I would never have initially gotten involved with the community.</p>

<p>Some examples of things this has happened:</p>

<p>Linux: first <a href="http://nblug.org/">NBLUG</a> then <a href="http://cplug.org/">CPLUG</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Gorgonnash&amp;amp;n=Icco">World of WarCraft</a>: The diversity of people, guilds, and the forums. I'm more of a watcher of this community, mainly because I'm not nearly as hardcore as most, but I enjoy the culture non-the-less.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Knight_2">Jedi Knight II</a>: O how I loved this game, in fact it's probably the game that got me hooked on FPS, and I never beat it. Want to know what happened? I fell in love with <a href="http://thejediacademy.net/">The Jedi Academy</a>. This was an amazing place that promoted teaching others cool things in the game. In my mind it was basically a never ending online Bar Camp.</p>

<p>Web 2.0/Social Media: <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Bar Camps</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/icco">Twitter</a>, the whole community behind it. Here's to someday maybe getting invited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">FooCamp</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>: This is what actually got me hooked on Web 2.0. Back when 1.2 hit I spent a lot of time on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/10">plugin forums</a> learning about <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> and helping others.</p>

<p>Case Modding/Computer Hardware: Let's not even talk about this. I was very active in a few communities, namely <a href="http://www.hardwaregeeks.com/">Hardware Geeks</a>, but I visited and posted on probably around 20 different forums and followed around 50 different blogs.</p>

<p>There have been a few other communities I've been active in, namely <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">MegaTokyo</a> and <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny-Arcade</a>,  but my involvement there is similar to my involvement to WoW. I follow what happens in the community, but I rarely participate.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'd like to end with a quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote>"it's not because we're gamers. It's not even because we're hardcore gamers. It's because we're such fanatical culturalists that we forget about the middle ground."</blockquote>

Needless to say, it's not really a plan, but more of an idea. This idea being "make others happy, be happy, and stay happy."</p>

<p>I've tried writing this post a few different ways, but I think John's little list got me to at least make my own list, so I can avoid writing the epic novel that would be my outlook on life (not to mention the fact that it's ever changing...). But none the less, john made a list, so I figured I would make a list.</p>

<p>This list is not in order in any sort.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Develop a web-application that is used by 10,000 people</li>
    <li>Get my name in the credits of some piece of art (not sure if I want to include software as art, if so I've done this, more on that later...)</li>
    <li>Eat</li>
    <li>Sleep</li>
    <li>Hike the John Muir Trail</li>
    <li>Live in Boston</li>
    <li>Live in Europe</li>
    <li>Visit Japan</li>
    <li>Turn 21</li>
    <li>Be Happy</li>
    <li>Volunteer</li>
    <li>Become a Teacher</li>
    <li>Visit every National Forest in the USA</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, that's my list. What's your list?</p>

<p>So I decided, with a little persuasion from my roommate, to do this Project 365 thing. The concept, is very simple. You take a picture of yourself once a day for a year. This concept, in implementation is much more than simple. Problems so far a) Remembering. That's kind of a given. I was pretty sick right after we started, so taking care of myself took priority. b) Taking photos at night. Since I've been forgetting left and right a lot of my photos have been at night, which my camera does not handle well. c) Speaking of my camera, I love it, mainly because I can take it anywhere and it takes a beating like a champ, but I am starting to realize how much the image sensor sucks, which is annoying.</p>

<p>But whatever, I'm having fun. I've included a slideshow above of what I've done so far, and my three favorite photos, so far, below.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Switch to <a href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a>. I've been a long time reader of <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/">BinaryBonsai</a> and I've been following Habari's development on and off. I think it's reached a point where I'm ready to switch over.</li>
    <li>Code my own Design from scratch. I've switched between hand-coded designs and using other people's designs for awhile. I think when I make the switch to Habari will be the right time to do this. I'm looking for a mix between <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/">BinaryBonsai</a>, <a href="http://ma.tt/">Ma.tt</a>, and <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Subtraction.com</a> I think. I also plan on making <a href="http://natwelch.com">natwelch.com</a> simpler. Start having it pull from different content streams on this site and others. That way new posts here will fill in that site more.</li>
    <li>Finish coding <a href="http://ideaius.com">Ideaius</a>. Seriously. My original plan was to release Monday, which is not happening. So I'm gonna aim for Christmas and pray no one makes something better before then.</li>
    <li>I'm not sure how much of this site I'm going to save. After I lost all of my posts two years ago, I gave up writting on this site. I think if I commit to one good post a month and port just my favorite posts from here, I'll be happy.</li>

<blockquote>Hey, if you guys are in Santa Rosa, my mom was hoping that you could come up to my house and talk to my brother and his friends about engineering and computer related majors. They'll probably want to know stuff about classes and success. The usual. There are two dates up for grabs, either sept. 8th or 10th. There will be food provided, of course. It will take place in the evening. Please let me know which one you would prefer if you can make either. If you cannot make either at all, what would be one piece of wisdom you'd like to pass on to my brother and his friends? Thanks a bunch if you guys can do this!!</blockquote>


<p>Here was my response:</p>

<p>I sadly will be unable to make either of those dates. But words of wisdom? Man, I'm full of cough shit cough cough wisdom. he he.
<!--more-->
All seriousness though, Engineering is awesome, for some people. So instead of just giving one piece of advice, like a good instruction following person, I'm gonna share my views on engineering.</p>

<p><strong>First, the bad things about engineering:</strong></p>

<p>Engineering is tough. It requires a decent amount of math (varies depending on school and major) and science (also varying). A lot of schools give you a path that you must follow, which can feel restricting compared to your liberal science brethren who are going all willy-nilly taking all of these cool random classes. Your classes will stretch the way you think about things and expose you to just about every aspect of the world (except women, that's what parties are for). Becoming an engineer is a commitment, a commitment which will require you to take some classes you despise and some classes which you love, and all will take up more time than you ever knew you had.</p>

<p><strong>Second, the good things:</strong></p>

<p>Engineering classes teach you really cool things. This sounds kinda lame, I know, and it is very hard to express, but imagine learning the coolest aspect of something you've always wondered about. That's engineering. Example: I'm a computer science major (engineering at some schools, math at others, watch out if that's your thing) and near the end of last year we had a lecture where we learned how to take advantage of the inherent security flaws that our society has. Then we practiced exploiting those flaws in a safe legal environment to learn how to protect our systems from such problems. Also, another example, a friend of mine likes cars. She joined one of the performance racing teams on campus and now builds race cars from scratch. This summer she got to spend two weeks with her team in London racing the car they built. Another guy I know took what he learned and teamed up with a professor. Together they started a company which was recently acquired by amazon.com.</p>

<p><strong>Thirdly, Summarization:</strong></p>

<p>If you become an engineer, and I recommend it, your mind will be put to the test during college. But afterwords you will be the one who your peers will come to when they need an innovative way to do something, whether it be a new type of engine, software program, bridge, nano-machine, or space station. O ya, and you'll get paid more than anyone else to do it (I make $28 an hour as an intern at Adobe Systems).</p>

<p>Hope that helps. I offer two final things: One, if you are interested in going to Cal Poly I will gladly give you a tour, and a place to stay if needed (my couch is comfy :p ). Second if you have any questions about Engineering, English (my other passion), or Computer Science (my specialty), leave a comment below.</p>

<p><a href="http://drhorrible.com/">Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog</a> is the greatest musical recently. Don't believe me? Check out the screen shot of the<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=284353399"> iTunes Music Store</a> to the left.</p>

<p>And while I loved the show and was thoroughly entertained with all of the great plot twists and funny songs, what really got me was the marketing scheme. When I say that the market scheme got me, I mean it reeled me in like a free bottle of beer and a beautiful brunette. Why does this series of three fifteen minute movies have me tripping so? Let me explain how I digest media.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Come across something cool,  let's say a new movie. (Discovery)</li>
    <li>I watch the trailer, listen to music samples, check it out on Wikipedia. (Research)</li>
    <li>Digest. If the movie is new enough and I'm not totally broke, I'll go see it. If the album isn't from a band I have obtained at least two albums from before, or if the movie isn't available for rent cheaply, then I will probably obtain it in less than legal means.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now how did Dr. Horrible throw a wrench into this tried and true formula? He abused two simple facts about my life.</p>

<ol>
    <li>I had to leave for the train in fifteen minutes, and I still had to eat breakfast.</li>
    <li>It was less than five dollars.</li>
</ol>


<p>I clicked subscribe on iTunes and sync'd Act 1 to my iPod. Half an hour later I was watching it in my seat on <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">CalTrain</a>. It was amazing. I wanted more, but I had to wait a day for the next episode, which I had already paid for.</p>

<p>What can wanna-be producers and marketers take out of this? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=spell&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;q=joss+whedon">Joss Whedon</a> explicitly said that working with iTunes was painful, but worth the effort, since he was offering it free online. Marketers, if you make something of quality (you need to care about your work, kinda crazy eh?) and let me consume it in whatever way I want, I will. My generation grew up with Napster and Kazaa. We know how to get what you don't want us to have. So give it to us with an affordable price tag and we'll buy it.</p>

<p>They recently pushed their beta site design live, and it's beautiful. I've been using it to listen to music at work which has been amazing. I enjoy it more than <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>, mainly because it isn't so ad heavy.</p>

<p>My history with Last.fm is strange to say the least. I started using their services back when they were <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">AudioScrobbler</a>. I really liked the concept of the data collection they were doing. They logged every song I listened to on my computer, on multiple media players. Since then the site has been was merged into Last.FM and I've loved it ever since.</p>

<p>Some of the features Last.FM has added recently I really like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>iPod Scrobbling (they track the music I listen to on my iPod as well as my computer)</li>
    <li>Full Tracks, not just the 30 second clips they used to have</li>
    <li><a href="http://build.last.fm/">A powerful API.</a> There used to be a decent <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/">API from AudioScroble</a>r, but it has since been upgraded by Last.FM and they have added a cool app gallery.</li>
</ul>


<p>The app gallery should really be highlighted here. Mainly because it allows access to historical data of what you have been listening to for a long period of time (four years for me I think).</p>

<p>Anyway, check Last.FM out if you haven't already. If you want to add me as a friend or see my musical tastes, it is located here.</p>

As a language it lets you do all kinds of cool things to the browser, but it also has a tendency to have very ugly code. Through my travels on the internet I came across all kinds of reports about how <acronym title="Cross Site Scripting">XSS</acronym> could steal everything you know without you ever knowing.</p>

<p>But these last few weeks have changed all of that. I decided to rebuild my <a title="Nat Welch .com" href="http://natwelch.com" target="_blank">personal site</a> (<a title="Prototype NatWelch.com" href="http://natwelch.com/index2.php" target="_blank">as seen here</a>) with javascript. Now it must be understood, I did not code this cool little accordion thingy. The credit for that goes entirely to <a href="http://www.dezinerfolio.com/2007/07/19/simple-javascript-accordions/" target="_blank">dezinerfolio.com</a>. I came across these guys through <a href="http://www.ajaxrain.com/" target="_blank">AjaxRain.com</a> and it worked well. The other thing it did was that the source code was included with the compacted code. Through looking at the source I learned that Javascript doesn't need to be incredibly scary, and with a little work it can even be readable.</p>

<p>Anyway, figured I would share.</p>

<p>p.s.s. Fullscreen Editor that now comes with Wordpress rocks. Another reason why Javascript kicks butt.</p>

    <li>I lost the Innovation Quest Competition, which put a small hold on Ideaius development. I've been working on it when I get a chance, which is another reason this blog isn't getting updated.</li>
    <li>I'm working at Adobe with the Dreamweaver Team again this summer. I've posted a picture of my commute above.</li>
    <li>I am going to PAX again this summer. Super psyched. I would post links to my co-conspirators, but they refuse to have websites...</li>
    <li>CalTrain still doesn't have WiFi. Booooo.</li>
    <li>I officially am renting a room in a house in SLO. To commemorate the occasion, I bought a Popcorn Hour. Totally Stoked.</li>
    <li>I'm starting to get the hand of JavaScript and AJAX. It's kinda neat, although my &lt;3 still belongs to server side languages.</li>

<p>I do love me some video games. One of the things I am particularly excited about is Valve's upcoming Orange Box. The Orange Box looks to be one of the best deals in gaming, plus just amazing, all in a box, that is a sexy shade of orange.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/index.php">Gametrailers.com</a> has provided many a enjoyable trailer for the gamers delight, and Valve has released many <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/85205.html">trailers for the upcoming Orange Box</a>, including the game I am most anticipating, <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/11883.html">Portals</a>.</p>

<p>And while I am looking forward to Portals a lot, I am enjoying the trailers that Valve has been releasing for Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress was always a lot of fun when I was younger. I love playing the engineer, mainly because of the fact that you could build these gigantic turrets. Well Valve has finally <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/24780.html">released the Engineer movie</a>, and it is hilarious. So if you have time, go watch the Engineer movie, and go <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/">read up on the Orange box</a>, which will be amazing.</p>

<p>Enjoy,

<p>The Merchant of Death. Awesome.  Check out <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/ironman/">the trailer page</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)">Ironman wikipedia page</a>. So a few comments on this film trailer. First, I think the Robert Downey Jr. was a great choice for the role, at least it seems so in this trailer. I'm hoping that he can play the cocky bastard / genius / superhero role well. It looks like he definitely has Stark's pre-Ironman image down pat. On top of this, it seems like the suit does a great job looking like the Iroman costume from the modern comic books, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_%28comic_book%29">Civil War</a>.Finally I am happy that the movie is located all in California, even though the comic is based in New York. Why? Because California doesn't get enough love from Marvel :p</p>

<p>You are most like <a href="http://www.photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a>. Though you recognize your authority, you do not relish the idea of using your power too aggressively. Instead, you rely on peers a lot. You do participate in the social media world, but it is not something that occupies a lot of time. You most likely devote yourself to projects that you feel passionate about and tend to evangelize those things quite a bit.</p>

<p>One item that was announced Wednesday, will, I hope, promote this. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/steve-jobs-live-apples-the-beat-goes-on-special-event/">September 5th at an Apple press conference</a>, Apple announced some very interesting things that has the blogosphere buzzing. The big news is that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/apple-cuts-iphone-price-to-399/">the iPhone is now $200 less</a>, but whatever, it's the price they pay as early adopters (update, jobs is a crafty bastard and is <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/">giving them $100 in store credit</a>). The slightly less big new, but very interesting in my mind, is the release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a>.</p>

<p>I love the concept of the touch because it has the two things that I need, wi-fi and an mp3 player. Apple goes even farther by adding a browser. Now of course you will tell me that the iPhone does all of this. But the iPhone only has 8gigs of music, where my computer has 40. Plus I don't have the money to upgrade my service plan to support the phone at $20 a month minimum.</p>

<p>The touch does everything I want, at least until I am brought back to reality. The touch has only 16 gigs, while my computer has 40, and my 3 year old iPod has 20. Plus what I really want wi-fi for is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>, which Apple says won't happen, since there is no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDK">SDK</a>. I also can't use flash on either the touch or the iPhone. O ya, the touch also doesn't support email or iChat or anything else besides a basic browser and Apple's music store.</p>

<p>Well you know what my solution to all of this? Ignore the huge gap in size between the touch and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/">the Classic</a> (what if I want 40, not 16 or 80 Apple? You guys suck) and buy the Classic. So last night at the opening of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/losgatos/">Los Gatos Apple Store</a>, That's just what I did. I'll have a review of the Classic up sometime this weekend, I hope.</p>

<p>The other news that I want to mention is that <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is planning on <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2963412130">opening it's entire directory to search engines</a>. Why is this good? because now when someone types in your name into Google, if you deem it so in your security settings and you have a Facebook account, a very simple piece of information will present it self, your name, your picture, and the ability for the person to join Facebook and add you as a friend and/or message you. This is a genius marketing strategy, and will probably get many users onto Facebook. This will also, I hope, promote more Facebook users to pay close attention to their security settings, because the default ones are somewhat open. The cool thing about Facebook though is that you can very easily lock down your profile so that only people you approve can see anything about you.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all for now. The blogosphere has been pretty active as of late, so much news I don't have time to write about it ;)</p>

<p>Hasta,<br/>

<p>p.s. I think the iPhone's a scam, but none the less <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/09/06/dear-steve-jobs/">Scoble's right</a>. We need an SDK. If there were an SDK I would buy an iPod Touch in addition to my Classic (but I would not pay $100 for the SDK...).</p>

I only attended on Saturday, and for what I attended, it was amazing.</p>

<p>For those of you who are lost on what BarCampBlock is, I'll give you a quick once over. BCB is a <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a>, which came in response to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">FooCamp</a>, an invite only event held at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>'s <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/seb_directions.csp">Sebastopol office</a>s. The concept of both conferences is basically take a normal conference and cover it in web2.0 and chaos. The web2.0 because the attendees are the ones giving speeches. Everyone is expected to give some sort of talk, or at least contribute to the discussions. The chaos comes from the fact that the schedule is as the attendees make it. You show up, put your topic in a time period and go. But somehow it all works out, and everyone learns a lot. As <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/">Tara Hunt</a> said at the opening of BarCampBlock, BarCamps are what you make them.</p>

<p>So, what did I do at this little shindig with over 900 people in a little corner of <a href="http://www.city.palo-alto.ca.us/">Palo Alto</a>? Well I showed up around nine am on Saturday with <a href="http://drewyates.net/">Andrew Yates</a>, originally planning on helping out at the front desk. The help didn't seem to be needed, so we grabbed a cup of coffee and then helped put the infamous grid together.</p>

<p>Then there was a little opening ceremony and the gates were figuratively opened and the grid was bum rushed as people went to get their topics up on the gird. Mass chaos ensued. It was awesome. :)<!--more--></p>

<p>Due to the fact that I really just want to get this article out, I think I'll just give you a list of cool things from this event.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Met <a href="http://opensermo.com">Ethan of opensermo.com</a>. Interesting college student out of <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">UofFlorida</a> who runs an interesting news videopodcast on his site.</li>
    <li>Met Nathan Schmidt, <a href="http://pbwiki.com/team.php">the CTO of PBwiki</a>. Nathan was a lot of fun to talk to and kept me rather entertained during <a href="http://ross.typepad.com">Ross</a>'s Wikiality session.</li>
    <li>Went to a very interesting session on "Craft 2.0." This was actually my favorite session, mainly due to the variety of topics we covered including the shift away from geographical based styles to preference based styles, and the mashup culture.</li>
    <li>Ate pizza.</li>
    <li>Went to a session with a much different topic than I had originally thought it would contain, but it was awesome none the less. This session was on BarCamp Sponsorship, and instead of speaking on how to get sponsors for BarCamp, the session was a discussion between two evangelists for Microsoft(Update: Anand Ayer and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/bios/Detail.aspx?ID=146&amp;productID=P-1R1L4&amp;pagesize=8&amp;pagination=true&amp;pageNumber=4">Jas Sandhu</a> were their names) and four of the BarCampBlock organizers (<a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">Chris Messina</a>, <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/">Tara Hunt</a>, <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/">Ross Mayfield</a>,  <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek Çelik</a>).</li>
    <li>Attended an  amazing session on exactly what is needed  in web2.0, an app that actively tells you what other networks your friends are on. (<a href="http://www.andrewmager.com/2007/08/19/understanding-social-network-portability/">this is a great review of the session</a>)</li>
    <li>Also attended what ended up being a Q and A about OAuth.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some nice reviews of the whole shindig</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Meeting two employees I had seen on the net, in person
I met <a href="http://twitter.com/dom">Dominic</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/kestelnon/">Ken</a> in person at Dreamweaver’s Frumpy Friday. Dom I had been following on twitter, and Ken I had found on Flickr.</p></li>
<li><p>Read a good review of one of my favorite companies.
I love <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/retail/">Timbuk2</a>. They make amazing bags, and their <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/hacker">new Hacker bag</a> looks pretty schweet. Laughing Squid has <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/timbuk2-hacker-bag-the-ultimate-vertical-laptop-bag/">a great review of the Bag</a>. And I think that this bag will sell very well of the SF based company.<!--more-->
But I do have a little hatred to send Timbuk2’s way. My hatred is in the from of their pricing. WTF. $120 for a bag? You guys make great stuff but this is a total stretch. If someone can justify why they can charge so much for their bags, and other lower quality bags are one third the price, then all hush up. But $120, plus another $20 for shipping is ridiculous. Now I say lower quality, because they are, but I don’t see why the upgrade in quality is worth triple the price. Also, hit me if I’m mistaken, but if it’s not a messenger bag, it’s not even made in the USA, one of the big reasons they charge extra. So ya, WTF Timbuk2.</p></li>
<li><p>Came across one of original “inspirations”
I spent another ten minutes browsing the Laughing Squid Archives, and came across a link to <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/chaos-communication-camp-2007-photos/">Jacob Applebaum’s photography</a> of two recent hacker conventions. <a href="http://appelbaum.net/">Jacob</a> has a special place in my heart, although he doesn’t know it. My freshman year of high school, I moved to Santa Rosa and started attending <a href="http://nblug.org/">NBLUG</a> meetings. One of the early meetings I went to was a presentation on Wireless networks and the security related to them. Jacob was the one giving this presentation (he had black hair at the time) and was one of my bigger inspirations at the time to spend more time jerking around in Linux. So it was neat to see him on the front page of <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/">Laughing Squids blog</a>, and taking amazing photographs, something I have also gotten into since high school started (although not because of him).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally my experiences on the train today.
This morning near Redwood city, a car was stuck on the tracks. So in the brilliance that is CalTrain, they shoved everyone off of the train and said buses would show up. Two showed up in an hour. Sadly two buses cannot fit the same capacity as a fully packed express train. So after an hour waiting in the sun, a local train picked us up, and half an hour later, we got to sf.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Then this evening, I got on the wrong train. And CalTrain does this stupid thing were they close the doors two minutes before they leave. So when I realize that I’m on the wrong train, I can’t get off. So I’m stuck adding 45minutes to my train ride. So lame.</p>

<p>And with that, I sign off.

Serif provides interesting designs that usually center around typography. Serif also talks about innovations in type and other news in the design world.</p>

<p>One neat thing that Serif does is hold these things called "revisions." Revisions allow for readers to send in their versions of current designs. The current revision, <a href="http://www.serifpublishing.com/?cat=48">revision 4</a>, ends today. Revision 4 asked readers to design covers for their favorite books. I am very sad that I stumbled across this so late, because I would have loved to make a cover for my favorite book, Neuromancer.</p>

<p>So head on over to Serif and <a href="http://www.serifpublishing.com/index.php?cat=48&amp;amp;paged=5">check out some of the designs</a> people have submitted. They are all very good.</p>

I even think that requiring students to declare a major upon entering college is ridiculous. The current mindset in parenting is to push kids into maturity at a younger age, and this in my mind is what is causing all of the problems we have in education, especially here in California.</li>

My favorite Genre, Author, and state of mind, all in one post? Hurrah!</p>

<p>Ok, I discovered a wonderful thing last year, right before the infamous wipe of my archives. This wonderful thing was a new Gibson book. I was so happy in my discovery I created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spook_Country&amp;amp;oldid=80331232">a Wikipedia post on it</a>,  and then forgot about it. Right before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0545010225">Harry Potter</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0545010225" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> premiered, I checked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country">the article</a>, only to find it was coming out a few days later. Huzzah!</p>

<p>But at the same time I had started my internship at Adobe, and thus it slipped again from my memory. Thankfully though,  <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/" title="who writes a great blog, btw">Michael Heilemann</a> showed me the light, when I stumbled  <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/07/25/gibson-on/">across his post</a>.  Praise the gods, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399154302?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0399154302">Spook Country</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0399154302" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> has been released and I will be going to buy it tomorrow.<!--more--></p>

<p>So yes, That is my first piece of consumerwhoreism. Also tomorrow I will in theory be ordering my new computer, and possibly picking up some manga. Basically I will be left overjoyed, and my bank account will be crying like a rape victim.</p>

<p>But enough of my bad analogies and metaphors. If you haven't read any of Gibson's work, I highly recommend his writing. The best three books that he has written so far I believe are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441569595?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0441569595">Neuromancer</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0441569595" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060539828?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060539828">Burning Chrome</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0060539828" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425198685?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0425198685">Pattern Recognition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pseudoweb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0425198685" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.</p>

<p>In other news, my server is running like a drunk fat twelve year old. Needless to say, all of my sites are suffering from his choice to break the law and drink. No alcohol on the job kid!</p>

<p>p.s. I never did mention this but I read and loved the latest Harry Potter. I have a half written post just sitting here as a review, but meh, Just go read it yourself.</p>

<p>You know what I love? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee">Hot Coffee</a>. You know why I love Hot Coffee? Because thanks to the whole lawsuit thing, Hot Coffee doesn't remind me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">wonderfully delicious drink</a>, instead it reminds me of coding and the nerd culture as a whole.</p>

<p>This weekend I attended <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse19">SuperHappyDevHouse 19</a>, known affectionately as shdh19. <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org">Shdh</a>, is at it's core a place for geek, nerds, designers, and developers of all kinds to meet, greet, and possibly even get a few personal projects pounded out in code. This time, shdh was located in Los Gatos, which was awesome because it was near my house. I originally went with the goal of programming, but ended up spending more time meeting people, which was better for me, I think, because I really don't know a ton of people in the area with the same interests as me. This of course is due to the fact that I haven't attended more of these events, not because they don't exist. Because in all honesty, finding computer "enthusiasts" in Silicon Valley is like finding people with bad teeth in fifteen century Britain.<!--more--></p>

<p>Anywho, here is a list of <em>some</em> of the people I met:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://jessicamah.com/">Jessica Mah</a> - Really cool girl. I was amazed at all of the stuff she had done, made me feel kinda lazy :p <a href="http://jessicamah.com/">
</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://tomicles.com/wordpress/">Tom Harrison </a>- The guy who proclaimed "I live here." Didn't talk to him too much, but I introduced myself, so I figure that counts <a href="http://tomicles.com/wordpress/">
</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://simblob.blogspot.com/">Amit Patel</a> - Had a really cool project using e7, the make controller, and legos<a href="http://simblob.blogspot.com/">
</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.kelek.com/">Mike McDonald</a> - A really interesting guy. We talked a lot about his acting career. I hope to see him on the big screen sooner rather than later<a href="http://www.kelek.com/">
</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://drewyates.net/">Andrew Yates</a> - A younger guy pursuing the silicon valley dream with an interesting startup to create something close to an online bank.<a href="http://drewyates.net/">
</a></li>
    <li>Conrad Rushing - A flash developer, he chilled with us in the hot tub for a long time. Seemed to have a very realistic view of the world</li>
    <li>Albert Mao - Bio-engineering(or something close to that) student. He seemed like a very competent programmer for his age.</li>
    <li><a href="http://sargo.com/joel">Joël Franusic</a> - One of the main greeters. He lives in SLO, which is awesome. I kept forgetting he was out of school though, which made me look like an idiot, but whatever, he seems like an awesome guy.</li>
</ul>


<p>I met way more than this, although I have the memory of a ninety year old woman. A few others I have buisness cards sitting on my desk at home, which I'll add soon, I promise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/1096435512/" title="The photo taken by CNet on Flickr" class="right"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1361/1096435512_8f89e8069c_s.jpg" alt="The photo taken by CNet on Flickr" height="75" width="75" /></a></p>

<p>There was also this CNet reporter, whose name I forgot to write down. I described my project to her, and I am a little worried about how she interpreted it. Also, I probably shouldn't have mentioned what school I went to, but whatever. If i am lucky I won't even end up in the article. She did take a good picture of me though, which was cool.</p>

According to <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2007/07/email_futures.html">this post by Mitchell Baker</a>, the Thunderbird product is not getting enough love, and I totally agree. Having thought about the topic a little, I think one of the better solutions is to break Thunderbird off and create the Thunderbird Foundation. Although I don't have a buisness background, or even a deep connection to the Thunderbird movement, here is my reasoning.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Thunderbird is a powerful product but the shadow that <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> and the infamous <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/default.aspx">Outlook</a> cast is dark and long. While many know of Thunderbird's existence, it is not a mainstream product the way Firefox is. Creating a separate foundation will, in theory, promote much needed hype and help Thunderbird establish itself more as it's own product and not the bastard child of Firefox.</li>
    <li>In terms of Outlook, Thunderbird has heavy competition. Outlook is one of those applications that works well enough, but it is so widely used, especially in the business world  that many users aren't realizing it's potential. I believe that if Thunderbird gets moved to it's own foundation, it could have the opportunity to have more money and people thrown at it, not too many mind you, and become a more professional app.<!--more--></li>
</ul>


<p>There are some downsides to this too, and if you see any I miss, I would love your input. For example, depending on how this split works out, the association with the well known name Mozilla may disappear. This could be good or bad. from a power user standpoint, I know that there will be good developers coming from a strong team to keep the project going. But if for say a government group or a large compan unassociated with the technology spectrum were to think of adopting it, some might be scared because of having no big name backing it. We must remember  that there are companies that still believe in the idea that since microsoft makes it, it must be good and everything we own will stop working if we don't use there products.</p>

<p>Overall though, I think Thunderbird has a shot as long as something is done. While I feel creating a new foundation will help Thunderbird's largest problems, overall market share and general use in the professional market, there is a possibility that the other suggestions Mitchell made will do a better job. Discussions need to happen, and a decision needs to be made, sometime this year hopefully.</p>

<p>Thanks to the infamous Matt for <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/07/28/thunderbird-unncertainty/">bringing this to my attention</a>.</p>

<p>And as a side note on how big Firefox's shadow is, look at the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/">Mozilla Home Page</a>. The page is 85% Firefox, and 15% Thunderbird. Along with that, if you are on the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird page</a>, and click on the link to add-ons, the add-ons page that shows up is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">the Firefox add-ons page</a>. There isn't even a link to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird add-ons page</a>. Plus a few of the other links on the Thunderbird page refer to Firefox stuff.</p>

<p>Hasta,</p>

First off, Friday night, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows">Harry Potter</a>. I don't know how much needs to be said about Harry and his wacky adventures, but I've been reading this since the first book came out in Britain, and I am hooked. It amazes me how much this book sucks me in. I normally get sucked into books, but I swear I'm addicted to HP and all of it's goodness. What's even funnier, I don't like Harry too much as a character. Sure he's interesting and angsty and all, but the two things that suck me in are Harry's past (you know the whole, good morning Harry, your life sucks, time to go be a wizard thing) and the supporting characters. Ginny, Hermione, Ron, the twins, Neville, all of the professors, etc. It's just how well developed the world is that J.K. Rowling writes about. I feel as though I can reach out and touch it, yet not too much is described so my mind can wander.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I will be attending <a href="http://2007.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>. In all honesty, I would much rather attend <a href="http://2007.wordcamp.org/schedule/">Sunday</a>, but more about that later. I am really excited about the general idea, and I'm hoping the event will get me excited enough to get me writing more often. As I said, I had hoped to also go on Sunday, because I love the developer side of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, I'm even thinking I might finally release the few plug-ins I "wrote" (as in I wrote them, but they suck), so the extra help would have been nice, but oh well.
<!--more-->
So why can't I spend Sunday in the city? Because I'm running in Wharf to Wharf.  Yes, I'm stupid, I know, leave me alone. So pray for me, and lend me your athletic ability while you sleep till a reasonable hour.</p>

For the 4  or so of you still visiting my page, welcome. As a few of you know, through <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, or just general contact, I have recently returned from a trip with my immediate family to eastern China. I visited five wonderful cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi An, Guilin, and Shou Zhou, each incredibly different, and all relatively large.</p>

<p>I've been staying away from the details of exactly what we did, mainly because it's pretty detailed. But I'll give you guys a little run down of the trip. We landed in Beijing, and i got food poisoning from the buffet dinner we had at the Hotel. While my parents and brother spent the next day touring the Forbidden Palace, Temple of Heaven, and Tienanmen Square, I got used to pucking ever half hour. The next day we hit up the Great Wall of China and some tombs. And the next day we visited the Summer Palace and took a plane to Xi An. <!--more--></p>

<p>I learned a lot in Beijing as it was my first time in any Eastern country, let alone any country that truly was a developing nation. Call me sheltered if you like but the trip was definitely a wake up call. Never before did I so carefully think about how things were prepare, think about not eating the ice cubes or drinking the tap water. But while this all made me think a little, I also grew great respect for the Chinese people. The majority of work was done by hand and many crafts that have long been lost in western countries were still being refined. Plus the majority of road work was and construction was done and they were still faster than CalTrans. The sheer amount of people that could be put towards a task was amazing.</p>

<p>As I said, from Beijing we visited Xi An (pronounced She On... I think), which was one of the prettier cities and more interesting places we visited. Deeply different from Beijing, the city was only eight million compared to Beijing's sixteen and had so many more young people walking around. Plus the ghetto of the town(which has to be driven through when coming from the airport) looks like a communist block, which was interesting to say the least. Xi An is home to various temples, universities, and tombs, plus the Terra-Cotta Warriors. It has a beautiful city wall and very nice people, plus a large Muslim community.</p>

<p>After two nights in Xi An we flew  over to Guilin. Guilin was the smallest town we visited, nearing 600,000 people. It had many pretty hills, which weren't really hills, more of limestone tower, but tomato, tomata, right? We took a cruise down the Li River which showcased all of these hills, as did a car ride through some of the smaller surrounding farming communities.</p>

<p>The limestone towers also create beautiful caverns, and we visited one of them. We also took part in various tours of areas around the city, each with it's own charm. After two nights in Guilin we took a 9 pm flight to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Shanghai is the New York of the Orient. Incredibly westernized it contains buildings from every part of the world. All I can say is that you should visit the Bong, a large promenade on each side of the city, and you should leave yourself a day to walk around. It's amazing. Also, see the acrobats.</p>

<p>Finally we took a train  to Shou Zhou. Another eight million person city. On this day we relaxed, enjoying the city filled with gardens. Sadly here we had our worst lunch, but everything else was so nice it didn't matter. I feel that this is probably a good time to mention how badly they drive in china. The only two laws that drivers follow in China is the sped limit and stop at stop lights, but even those are broken very commonly. Traffic lanes, right of way, and general courteousness when driving is all ignored. How so few people die i do not know, but i was scarred for my life every time i crossed the street, let alone get into a car.</p>

<p>But overall I did have a great trip. I tasted many exotic foods(avoided the roasted bulls penis though), explored many ancient buildings and had a lot of fun. The 11 hour flight was totally worth it, plus I technically lived the 30th twice, so it was all good.</p>

<p>Have a good night people,</p>

On May 19th Blizzard announced Starcraft 2. I suggest you go check out the above sites, just because they give great pictures of both gameplay and concept art.</p>

<p>Most of the units have been retooled and things look cleaner and it sounds as though choices were made to make the three races better. The issue that i am noticing is that right now the game seems to have the same interface. The game basically looks the same.  I am really hoping that they make some significant changes because right now, i dont see why people would want to spend the money. I understand that the game is not yet finalized, but seriously, would you pay $50 for  a retooled version of an old game?</p>

<p>Well I'm hopeful. Blizzard has done a lot right with their Warcraft series, now if we are lucky they might make up for Starcraft: Ghost.</p>

<p>But the one thing that really hit home was while showing my teacher a resume cover letter. My letter had a list of three websites, she said she would look at this one. No reason given, she just said she would look "at that pseudoweb one" which gave me mixed feelings. For one, I'm glad that this isn't two years ago where this website was full of bad jokes and angry statements towards my school's administration, but it also signals a stage which I think many of my generation are coming to, and it is biting them in the ass.<!--more--></p>

<p>The stage I speak of is where you have to become a respectable member of society, and everything you do is now judged by two parties, your peers, and those who might wish to make you a peer. My generation has grown up with the internet, and thus everything we have done since we were children is somewhere on the internet. We were in the midsts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> battles and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaZaA">Kazaa</a> arrests, we rode the internet social networking wave, leaving a trail of destroyed websites in our wake. We left our emotional dramas and teen angst on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/">Xanga</a>, we made funny pictures and got hunted by sexual predators on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, we made weird movies of our friends and put them on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, and finally we put our parties and drunkenness on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. A search for your name on Google shows up some interesting stuff, old pages from when you were twelve, weird antics, and your ramblings. The internet knows all.</p>

<p>But here is where it gets scary. When people employ you these days, it is a very common activity to Google your name. Sometimes that will come up with something neat, like your web page or resume. Other times it might be an embarrassing photo or post on some forum.</p>

<p>So these last few days I have been making the transition. Cleaning up my name, finding old stuff and deleting it. Adding new content which portrays me better and even signing up for new sites, meant more for those in my age group.</p>

<p>One of these sites is a social networking site for business professionals called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. It provides an easy way to make connections and find out who knows who. This seems like it would be incredibly valuable for finding ways into a job, plus it's always fun to see who my parents and my friends know.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's been interesting, and I won't lie about the fact that this post is just one of the things I want to do to keep my site active. You can also check out the changes I made over at <a href="http://natwelch.com/">natwelch.com</a>. I hope to eventually get a code portfolio going over there too, but that will come with time.</p>

<p>Well I'm off to bed, Hasta.</p>

<p>/Nat</p>

<p>And while this is all very cool, what is the best news is that companies are starting to release <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/technology/03music.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin">unencrypted versions of their songs on the iTunes music store.</a>  Possible in a response to <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Steve Jobs letter </a>proclaiming the DRM  music was the reason for low sales of music. I am really excited for this, because the more open standards, the more chances we have.</p>

<p>I am scared. I mind you, have no real reason to be scared, but the last few days have pushed me to the point where i should be scared. You see, I believe 2007 will be the year of the Internet Revolution. The Internet Revolution in my mind is where there is a dramatic shift in how things are done on-line. There has been a slow shift towards the dynamic over the past years. Things like RSS, Flickr and Del.ici.ous have allowed this dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2">Web 2.0</a> to grow. Web 2.0 is a group of software that promotes content that delivers itself to the user in the way the user wants. The user can lay out the page with AJAX the way he or she wants to see it, and only the information they want to see is there. (example: <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>).</p>

<p>This is evolving though. Things like <a href="https://www.youos.com/">YouOS</a> and <a href="http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix/">JS/UIX</a> are entire operating systems built on this Web 2.0  idea. But while these are all very amazing, the big thing that is happening is the push of streaming video over the Internet. YouTube is the site that is winning this war. But I beleive the war is just beginning and Google, YouTubes owner, knows it. The big deal, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070119_001510.html">as Cringely points out</a>, is that 50 percent of the Internet's bandwidth is being used by five percent of it's users over Bit Torrent. According to Cringely, Google is building these gigantic data centers (and they are gigantic) so that Google will be able to hold up the infrastructure of the web when it collapses due to the extensive use of Bit Torrent and other video downloading services. How will it work? very simply, you will be looking for a file, lets say The-Pirates-of-the-Carribean-2.avi from http://torrentwebsite.com and Google will be one of the highspeed providers when you look to download the file. Google will essentially be cacheing all of the popular data in one region in the local data center allowing for faster downloads and less overall bandwidth on the network.</p>

<p>But Although Cringely beleives that Google and he are the only ones who realize what is happening, I can assure you, that the ISP's know what is going on. How do i know this? the <a href="http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Net-Neutrality-Act-Once-Again-on-the-Agenda/31886">Net Nutrality Act is back on the agenda</a>. This act, at least as i understand it, is an act to allow companies such as AT&amp;T to charge companies such as Google depending on how much bandwidth they use. This in my mind promotes "Anti-Competitiveness." It makes it so server based applications such as google, flickr or web hosts would have to pay to exist. On top of that it would make developing and starting a company expensive, which would hinder all of the small startups. Which would hinder innovation and probably kill most free high bandwidth sites (youtube, itunes music store, etc.) But there is a positive side to all of this. We can hope that if the bill is passed then the backbone of the internet might be rebuilt, prolonging when the big crash might happen.</p>

<p>On top of this though, there are major battles happening to decided copywrite laws. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> for instance, <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">is calling for music to be free</a>, or at least unencrypted. This idea follows the whole idea of standards, which has helped many companies, including apple and Google to rake in the dough and be popular with their users. The only problem with standards, is that when it comes to the entertainment industry, standards are only good if you own them, and apple is advocating the move away from this. Acording to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> though, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020801855.html">the RIAA is not pleased</a> with jobs letter. But this is an ongoing issue that i am not sure i can even comprehend with out much more research, and i sadly do not have the time for such.</p>

<p>In the end though I just don't know what to think. I whole heartedly beleive though that this will be a very interesting next few years.</p>

<p>P.s. There is also an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/30/info-traffic-jams-oped-cx_pk_0131network.html">interesting article on Internet Bandwidth here</a>.</p></p>

<p>Breaking news! Two days of posting in a row! Read now!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>That was overly dramatic. Anyway, new WOW patch is in the wild, which supposedly nerfed my character, but it doesn't matter to me that much, but if you have a high level hunter you may be crying in your dark room, or it is very possible you just don't care.</p>

<p>In other news Steve Rubel claims <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/01/rising_dead_poo.html">The World is Ending</a>, or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#Thinning_the_herd">history is repeating itself</a>. This could be very bad for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, but i have a feeling it will be no where near as bad as it's previous encounter. What makes this one so special? Web 2.0 didn't get time to build itself up. You know the phrase the bigger you are, the harder you fall? Well it works in reverse too, the smaller you are, the less anyone cares.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hackaday.com/">Hack-A-Day</a>, one of my favorite sites, released an article, about you you can <a href="http://www.hackaday.com/2007/01/24/wiibot-armed-and-pointy/">mod your wiiMote to kill people</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry">John Kerry</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/us/politics/25kerry.html">will not be running for presidency</a>, Hallelujah, although i don't know if i can support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">a woman who believes Jack Thompson</a>.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/college/coll22ruckus.html">
Record companies are offering free music to students</a>, but they are stupidly following Microsoft's broken and unpopular encryption scheme. I'm not sure about the rest of you fools, but the one thing Microsoft doesn't get, it's students, and this, while a move in the right direction, is still not quite what is needed.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/us/25child.html">the president is moving to reinstate the "No Child Left Behind Act,"</a> which i am very opposed to, although i can't honestly come up with a better idea. I mean i really don't think standardized testing allows schools or students to flourish, but how else do we set up a way to test whether students deserve their diploma? The Other problem i have is that this new version allows the government to override state law, which i am never okay with...</p>

<p>Anyway that's the news, or at least what i found interesting. I honestly did read those stories, I am just a chronic liar.</p>

<p>Oi, I am tired.</p>

<p>Life these last few days has not been kind. I picked up world of warcraft (which is awesome i might add) but i can't play it due to large amounts of work.</p>

<p>What large amounts of work you ask? Well I had a program due Monday at 5pm, didn't meet that deadline. I could have turned it in today at 5pm for a B, didn't meet that deadline. Now i have till 5pm tomorrow to get a C, which i will do, i am nearly done, just have to figure out why my computer won't add things right. But still, it's a heavy weight on my sholders that i want to fling off, and it's just getting heavier every second i wait.</p>

<p>Anyway, lots of new photos up on Flickr, and speaking of which i need to write an article about my new camera :p</p>

<p>Also site is still in progress. Once i get a free weekend or heck a free day, i'll bust it out and i also plan on starting to write quality again some time soon.</p>

<p>Hasta</p>

<p>So I'm still alive, don't worry too much. I'm rebuilding this site again, so things may not work and stuff may be missing. If you see something broken just drop me a comment. I am now using a modified version of <a href="http://scottwallick.com/">Simplr</a>, although you won't be able to see most of the modifications till I upload them (sometime this weekend). I promise to start posting again soon...</p>

<p>Yes that is correct, <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NanoWriMo</a> is comming! You should <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/register.php">register! </a> and you could even look at <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=115575">my profile</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway NanoWriMo is really exciting me this year because of what i did last year. What i did last year was get very little done while participating, and now it is a new year and time for more dedication and maybe even successfulness! (that is so not a word...)</p>

<p>Anyway i have convinced a few people to join me and i am joinging a few others, so thankfully i am not alone.</p>

<p>Heres to a novel in one month!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saints_of_occupations_and_activities">Patron Saints of Stuff</a></p>

<p>There are funny Patron Saints for all kinds of things, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Amand">boy scouts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiacre">venereal disease</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zita">Housewives and Domestic servants and those who have lost items in their house.</a></p>

It’s been a long and hard struggle, but, I am still sick. In other news I have acquired myself a job. It is not a painstaking job, but it looks like it should help. Help because besides on the hour duties and basic maintenance jobs, I just sit and do my homework.</p>

<p>What is my job you ask? My job is that I am now THE LAB MONITOR!</p>

<p><!--more-->I am very excited that I got it, and after I turned in the paperwork yesterday, I went and bought myself a Cal Poly milkshake. It was delicious. But now that I have a job, a thought that had been lingering in the back of my mind since I started college really hit home.</p>

<p>You see this applies more to Computer Science students then it does others but basically now that I am in college I am both ethically and legally responsible for everything I do. This might seem very reasonable to someone who has been working in the industry for years, but to kids growing up in the current information age, not stepping over the line is very difficult.</p>

<p>What makes avoiding this line even harder is that it isn’t really a line, but more of a grey area comprised of various blurred lines, and each blurred line is a different expectation from a different set of people, whether they are your peers, your customers, the government, your family members, or just your own morals. So for everything I do, I must consult the little road map of lines to decide what my action will cause.</p>

<p>Why does this apply more to computer science then it does elsewhere? Let me explain. You see, everything I learn in class is a tool. The example one of my professors gave was that pretend that he is my father. My father likes to hunt and wants to show me how to properly use a firearm (they are not weapons, just firearms :p). So he shows me how to shoot things, clean the gun, load the gun, and store the gun. Now as a parent, should he stop there? No, right? What most parents then would continue on doing is to then teach the morals behind the tool. So in the firearm scenario, He would tell me what to shot, how not to hurt people and why guns can be bad.</p>

<p>The same is true for programming. You see in my classes I am not learning how to use the tool, I am learning when and for what purpose to use the tools. Learning to program is easy, you just read the book and go from there, it’s learning how not to use the software I write illegally that is what we need to be taught.</p>

<p>So when I decide that I want to watch the new superman movie, but can’t afford to buy it, I need to think whether or not tunneling through a firewall and downloading the movie is worth the A) punishment and B) the grief it will cause me and my fellow roommates when they cut off the internet. This of course is an extreme case, but none the less something I need to think about.</p>

<p>Never forget the totally abused Spiderman quote, “With great power, comes great responsibility.”</p>

<p>Hasta.</p>

You see, everyone is really excited that it is October and everyone knows what October means right? Halloween. I, unlike many, am not a big fan of Halloween. Some say that I am just a poor sport, but I really do not enjoy dressing up. Sure I love the benefits like large parties and loads of candy, but I never really enjoyed the day.</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Once again, Maybe it is just that I am crazy, but dressing up has never been a big thing with me. I never cared if it was cool or not, which is what I am often accused of. It's more of, like I said, the fact that I find no joy in changing my appearance.</p>


<p>Why this is I have no idea. I mean I have always had very happy Halloweens, and I usually spend them with friends as we romp through the streets looking for candy and other sources of amusement. Now, I hope that some realize that by age 18, you are a little too old to be trick-or-treating. We went last year, which was fun, but the weird looks the girls in my group got were a bit ridiculous. Sure we got candy, but to these people we all looked like teenagers who couldn't escape the fact that they weren't ten anymore.</p>

<p>Mind you, this is starting to sound like the old, too cool/mature for doing this sorta thing, but even if I was still twelve, I don't see the big draw to Halloween.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have had this discussion with many before, and I usually come out looking like the bad guy, because it sounds like I am bashing many peoples favorite holiday, but in reality, I just can't see what is so great about the day.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I know, I know, it has been a while. But here I am back in brute force. These last two weeks have been a blast even though i am now on my second strain of some crazy cold bug.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Cal Poly's motto is “learn by doing” and let me tell you, there is no doubt in my mind that this is exceptionally true. You see, I was thinking about it and it's not just the classes where Poly follows their motto.  You see WOW, or Week of Welcome as it is more commonly known, is a week where you travel around the community and the school and learn about what there is to do. You don't just sit in lectures telling you what you “could” do, but you actually go and do it.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">All of my classes have a lab section to them where I apply what I have learned in the most recent lecture or reading. On top of all of that the school is constantly trying to get everyone, especially those in the dorms, to try new things and apply themselves and get involved.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, I am having a lot of fun, even though i am getting a little sick. I promise to get to a regular posting schedule once I get used to this whole college thing.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Here are a few pictures i have taken since I got here. Sadly, i can't upload anymore because flickr lowered their upload rate. Maybe I will finally get a Pro account...</p>

I had discussions, comforted my math teacher (she used to work there), and worried for my cousin Becky who worked almost across the street from the World Trade Center.

Now this all seems pretty normal in my mind. It was something many people were going through, it was a national disaster after all. But what bothered me, was that it didnt hurt me that much. I usually conclude that this is because I live in California and that in my mind the WTC is not that big of a symbol. But I guess something doesnt need to be a symbol until its involved right?</p>

<p>But, whatever it may be, I am glad that as a country we are sticking relatively together. Iunderstand differences, because opinion is one of the founding principles of our country, but I wish people would just learn to see where the other is coming from. Yay for compromise!</p>

<p>Anyway, heres to the bad, the good, the new, and the old. Cheers!</p>

<p>Anyway, lets get back to the point of the post. I came across three great articles today. One is about Wikipedia, one is about showers, and one is about self expression. So lets get started.
<!--more-->
Ok, <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, is one of the greatest things on the internet. It helps spread what I think is the most important thing in the world, Information. Without information we would all be clueless. Plus, information promotes individuality and all kinds of stuff I love, but I will hold the information is better than money speech for another day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Raw Thought</a> has an article out describing <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia">who writes Wikipedia</a>. An interesting read that brings to light some interesting things. First of all, 0.07% of Wikipedia users make 50% of the edits. This is a scary fact and made me wonder. How can so few people hold, create, and publish so much raw information? Well the author went on to research this information and found that it isnt as scary. You see while very few people do all of the editing, many more users create the original information which makes me happy. Wikipedia is the knowledge of the universe put into a book. Can anyone say Hitchhikers Guide to The Universe?</p>

<blockquote>I come up with a lot of ideas and remember things to do while I'm in the shower. However, by the time I get out of said shower, I've forgotten 3/4 of what I'd come up with.</blockquote>


<p>This is so true. I wish I could fix this. <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/">Pinkerton</a> <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/archives/016928.html">is trying to solve this problem.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://coloradostartups.com/">Colorado Startups</a> informed me that <a href="http://coloradostartups.com/?p=97">to be someone you must exist on the web</a>. My roommate does not exist on the web. He must not exist. Who said Colorado knew anything?</p>

<p>So I love a lot of things in life. Today though, had a few of my favorite things, overcast weather, beautiful trees, kind people, and good music. I believe that with these things I can be happy in life, and I know it sounds silly, but here are my reasons why.
<!--more-->
<strong>Overcast Weather</strong>
Lets be honest, the sun is great. It helps everything grow, provides warmth and provides warmth. But nice overcast weather makes me feel so great. Its filtered sunlight provides soft shadows and makes everything far more vibrant than in the sun. It is far less warm, and I dont get sun burnt. And things still grow because the clouds dont full cover the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Beautiful Trees</strong>
Trees are great. I love how there are so many different varieties. I especially like Tall ones with big overhangs to provide speckled shadows and homes for squirrels. The fresh air that comes from trees is great to inhale. I dont know what else, but everything is better with trees.</p>

<p><strong>Kind People</strong>
Good people are awesome. They just make every day so much more enjoyable. For instance today I met this guy Alaska, he was just awesome to talk to, and our plan to herd deer was even better. People like Alaska, Maggie, Dave, Chris, Kristen, and everyone else all make each day fun to be alive. All in all, I like kind people because there are very few things that are better alone.</p>

<p><strong>Good Music</strong>
Tunes to walk to, tunes to drive to, and music to live to. As I roll through life I want to have music playing. I enjoy just about anything, so as long as it has some quality in it, it will add a little bounce to my step.</p>

<p>All of this came together this week. I kept running into various combinations of the four above things. I wrote an essay for my English teacher in sophomore year that talked about these very things. You see, anyone can see the bigger picture if they just open their eyes and look around. But if you want to find happiness in the little things in life, you really need to give the big picture the finger and just focus on everything as a separate entity. But be careful, you have a high chance of walking into a poll if you dont go back to the big picture every once in awhile.</p>

<p>Hasta.</p>

<p>Posts are going to be scattered for a little while, I am going to go through and see what is broken and what not.</p>

<p>I am in Santa Rosa also visiting some good friends and as they say Nating it up. So this weekend expect everything to clean up and stuff to get rolling again. I was able to recover one post from Googles cache, but I dont think Ill be bringing the rest back, because my backup hadnt happened yet (it was scheduled for Friday).  But if I get time Ill go back through. Anyway, sorry for the slow down and I hope to type this weekend.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>So interesting weekend, first off I was going to post something Thursday night, but I found out my web server was down. Same thing happened Friday night and Saturday morning, and then again today (today being Sunday) you see I am up in the mountains, and posting to you guys is hard, heck finding an internet connection is hard, but if you see this, then all is well.
<!--more-->
But I figure that I will share my pain with you. Nothing brings readers and bloggers together like internet horror stories, so take a seat (if youre not sitting already that is) and get ready for a fun little story.</p>

<p>So background first. I started on the internet a long time ago, back when I was five. I explored the vasttraces of the World Wide Web when my dad installed Windows 95, a big upgrade from the Windows 3.1 I had been using;it had games and stuff which was a blast. Anyway I ventured around and a few years later I became one of the first users of Geocities.com</p>

<p>Now geocities didnt use to be owned by Yahoo, but it was an amazing website. I built my own website with my moms help and I was off. Fast-forward eight years and I was taking a web-design class in high school. I proposed to my mom the idea of her owning a website, she was all heck yesand I was all Wahoo! Anyway I built her a website for my final that year and also built my own http://icco.lydiadehn.com, which has since become decommissioned.</p>

<p>The web host I chose was 8-95.com which had a wonderful deal, $3.95 a month for a full featured website. Since then our account has grown and now with over triple the original specs we only pay $7.95 a month. My moms website slowly fell into disarray but two years ago I bought pseudoweb.net and have been using it since. Since starting with 8-95.com I have had one period of downtime, five hours on a Sunday evening. But it was back when I woke up so I cant complain.</p>

<p>Thursday started the longest period of downtime since I joined this web host and I am a little worried because it is possible they cant access our backups (that server got corrupted too supposedly). Anyway, I hope it all turns out fine and this doesnt become the first post.</p>

<p>Also for those wondering, I upgraded my computer recently and accidentally deleted the records of what my previous styles looked like, but at version 3.5 and version 6 I reformatted my site and started from scratch. 3.5 was when I got Wordpress and pseudoweb.net, 6.0 was when I started college.</p>

<p>Hasta, for now.</p>

<p>p.s. It came back up on tuesday with nothing. Rebuilding as i can.</p>

Chumby is a hackers dream and it was released at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp"title="Wikipedia entry on foo camp">FOO</a> <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp06/index.cgi"title="the official wiki for foocamp"  >camp</a> this weekend. What is Chumby you ask? Well basically it has two very modifiable ends. The software and the hardware are both promoted as modifiable. In fact the company has already released the specs for both.<!--more-->
 What does this mean? Well a few things, first off you can redo the soft plushy exterior with whatever design you want. So my mom could sew a quilt for it or you could glue on your favorite patches. Then on the inside you can solder on new ports for something like an iPod or your phone. Finally there is the software end where you can program widgets the display things like the time, weather, RSSfeeds, email status and anything else you can imagine. 

 The web is abuzz with news about this thing and many are waiting to hear hw much it will cost and when it will come out. Im excited especially because I had thought of a similar design. Mine had a bigger screen that was a touch screen, but since<br />
Chumby is hackable, I can add that. The best thing is that people will publish how they do stuff and share their programs, so even if you cant program or solder people will be there to help you. 
 Im excited to say the least. 
 A few more sections of info: 
<blockquote> Chumby is different. The Chumby was not created in the design department of some big consumer electronics company. Market analysis and focus groups were not performed. Frankly, there wasnt very much traditional consumer electronics experience brought to bear at all. We made it all up. Chumby Industries was formed by hackers who wanted to create something interesting, useful and different. The starting point was the humble clock radio. What we decided to build was a really low-cost, wireless (WiFi), Internet-connected device that will sit on your bedside table (or in your bathroom, or kitchen, orliving room, or maybe even plug into your car somehow&#8230;) that could do a lot more than this old clock radio (or your cell phone, if thats what you use to wake yourself up.) And we named it &#8220;Chumby.&#8221;  -from the Chumby website </blockquote>
