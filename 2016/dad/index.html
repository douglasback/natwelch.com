    <h1>Happy Father&#8217;s Day!</h1>

    <p>Hey Dad,</p>

    <p>This is a little webpage from your two sons. We both love you a lot. You know this, but we figured this was a good time to remind you.</p>

    <p>We started by looking for a quote. Something that expressed the relationship you have with us. Your laughter, good nature, quiet comtemplation and constant stream of advice. We found a nice quote by Umberto Eco. </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&#8220;I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren&#8217;t trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Eco was a semiotician and fiction writer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/arts/international/umberto-eco-italian-semiotician-and-best-selling-author-dies-at-84.html?_r=0">who died this year</a>. And we&#8217;re not too surprised that someone who looked at symbols for a living is able to encapsulate the relationship between a father and his sons well.</p>

    <p>You&#8217;ve provided us both with a lot of wisdom. Whether it&#8217;s how to tie a fishing knot, advice on dealing with people or just general affirmations that everything is going to be alright. We truly appreciate it. We wouldn&#8217;t be the adults we are today without you.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, we are both impressed by all you have done in your life. Your success, perserverence, calm and professionalism in the workplace is inspiring. Now that you&#8217;re retired, we&#8217;re excited to see our wonderful parents relaxing. It&#8217;s funny though, you&#8217;re ability to shut off when you were not at work was always impressive, so seeing you relaxed now isn&#8217;t surprising or unusual. You&#8217;ve always had that calm demeanor.</p>

    <p>Anyways, we&#8217;d like to leave you with some photos.</p>

    <p>Lots of love,
    Nathaniel &amp; Travis</p>
